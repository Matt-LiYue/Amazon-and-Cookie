###Following the money:
####How Advertising Dollars Encourage Nuisance and Harmful Adware and What Can be Done to Reverse the Trend (CDT report 2006)

This report presents how the adware ecosystem works. It highlights that there are multiple entities that are involved in the ad chain. The distribution of ads can be complex so that in many cases the marketer cannot know where their ads are displayed. Therefore, nuicanse/harmful adware can also get commissions for delivering ads, which may not be desirable by the marketers. 

The report conducted a case study to identify the companies that appear in adwares developed by 180 solutions. It suggests that these companies may not have policies to restrain where their adds end up and whether deceptive and illegitimate affiliates are involved in the ads distribution channel. However, it did indicate that many of the marketers deal directly with 180 solutions to place their ads. 

It suggests every marketers to come up with ad policies so that any entity in the channel should obey. Besides, surveillance and dealing only with trustworthy affiliates are encouraged.

###Following the Money II:
####The Role of Intermediaries in Adware Advertising (CDT report 2006)

This is the follow-up paper of "__Following the Money__". This paper experimentally expose some facts in the adware market. They install 2 clean adware in separate machines and run the adware every 8 minutes for 7 hours a day for 10 days. Eventually they made 520 web site visits leading to 380 ad impressions. By observing how many HTTP redirects are made they identify the intermediates of actual marketers and ad deliverers. They established the following surprising observations. 

* over half of the ads used no intermediaries, which means the marketers made directly deal with the adware vendors.
* 20 percent of the ads involve only 1 intermediary. In the above 2 cases, the marketers should be aware that their ads are displayed in adwares.
* Large intermediaries are more likely to be involved in nuisance adwares because they work with so many marketers and affiliates.
* high-profile brands tended to use more intermediaries (2 in average while the total average is 0.7.
* 8 percent of ads are self-targeted, which means the ads are advertising for the websites that is being visited, this scenario strongly suggests that these marketers are bilked by the intermediaries or the adware partners. High-profile brands are more likely being victim of self-target.

Again the report only suggests to enforce policy and increase transparency. There is no new technique to enforce the ads are delivered by legitimate channel.
