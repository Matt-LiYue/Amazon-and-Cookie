Online user behavior has been largely studied in various fields due to the prosperity of Internet. In this paper, we investigate Amazon Wishlists, where users keep their desired products for easier access or providing guidelines to gift givers. We collected Wishlists and items of over 30,000 users, in the mean time showing interesting results on user online shopping behavior. Specifically, we show behavior difference in gender and geo-location. Besides, we also study shopping patterns in normal days and holidays. Surprisingly we found that user may not always like to shop during holidays. Finally, we demonstrate that information in Wishlists has potential to leak user personal information. We use state-of-art machine learning techniques (SVM) to train and test the data. Our result indicates that based solely on the items in users' Wishlists, their gender, education, and hobbies can be inferred with a considerable success rate.
