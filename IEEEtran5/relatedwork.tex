\section{Related Work}

There are a large amount of works that have been done to learn plain text. \cite{de2001mining} mines e-mail content for author identification. They study an extended set of email document features, which include structure, linguistic patterns, etc. They use SVM learning algorithm to differentiate the authors of emails. \cite{pang2002thumbs}presented algorithm for mining users' opinions of an item from their reviews of the items, classifying documents in overall sentiment. They use keywords appearing in the user comments of an item to infer whether the user like this item or not and to what extend do they like/dislike the item.

\cite{Lee:2010:USS:1835449.1835522} does statistical analysis of the properties of spam profiles collected from social network communities for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers. \cite{dave2003mining} describes the system infrastructure, identify the unique properties of list of product attributes and develops a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews in Movie Lens to link forum posts to mentioned items. \cite{kraft2007mashing}attempts to do on a set of Amazon wish lists spiders from web. They started by doing a wish lists search of people names(first names and nicknames from the baby names databases) and then retrieve the results linking to the wish lists of the first 25 matches.
